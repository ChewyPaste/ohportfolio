Hey there, I’m Marvin. I live in New York City and I’m a Fullstack Web Developer with a background in IT support and Hospitality. On the weekends I'm also a flight attendant for an airline that's featured in a song about broken guitars. But when I’m not in the air handing out pretzels, I'm at the airport troubleshooting ancient
enterprise software under the guise of tech support.
On my free time you can find me taking figurative walks while exceeding my monthly allotment of medium articles.
